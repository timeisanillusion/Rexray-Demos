This is designed to quickly demo docker on Windows (Using docker toolbox) and RexRay

The bat file is designed to just start the VirtualBox Web Service
The sh script is designed to start the docker machine, install rexray and then prompt to create a volume and containers to demo persistance

Nothing complex, just making it simple and repeatable for anyone using Windows
